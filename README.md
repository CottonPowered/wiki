{% hint style="warning" %}
CottonMC is in alpha and currently only covers Fabric and Quilt. This also means that the API doesn't have as many features as the Bukkit API
{% endhint %}

CottonMC is a project to write global software for Fabric, Forge, Paper, Quilt, NeoForge and Minestom. You can see if the modloader you are using is fully covered [here](coverage.md).

The goal of this wiki is to familiarize you with the project. Almost everything the API can do is covered here, but if you feel like something is missing don't hesitate to contact one of the contributors to help develop your plugin or expand the wiki.
